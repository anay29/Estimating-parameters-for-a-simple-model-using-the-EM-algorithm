# Estimating-parameters-for-a-simple-model-using-the-EM-algorithm
Estimate parameters for a simple model using the EM algorithm: What are the chances of heads and tails from two unlabeled coins? To figure it out I have implemented an EM algorithm that estimates the probability of heads for two coins using data from an API.
